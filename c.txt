As the instructions suggested, I did a JOIN with product and review on pid (p.pid = r.pid)
so that each review is tied to its product.

Since I wanted to expand each element in the comments array, I added a CROSS JOIN LATERAL
to the previous JOIN. Using the CROSS JOIN LATERAL lets the unnest function see the current
row from the review table and turn its comments array into one row per comment, which is named comment.

I filtered using the case-insensitive regex expression given, ~*'(defect|broken)', and by the category name
'electronics'.

From all of this I distinctly selected the product names and comments that match the filtering.
